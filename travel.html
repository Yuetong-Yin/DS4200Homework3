      <!-- Expanded Bullet Points -->
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Historical architecture and ancient city walls:</strong><br>
          Dubrovnik’s iconic medieval walls date back to the 13th century and encircle the Old Town for nearly two kilometers. Visitors can walk atop these walls for panoramic views of the red-roofed city below and the sparkling Adriatic Sea beyond. The city’s blend of Gothic, Renaissance, and Baroque architecture is a testament to its rich history, with each building telling a story of its own.

          <strong>Scenic coastal views:</strong><br>
          Perched along the azure waters of the Adriatic, Dubrovnik boasts dramatic cliffs, hidden coves, and picturesque beaches. Whether you’re standing on the city walls, sailing around Lokrum Island, or simply enjoying a seaside café, you’ll find breathtaking vistas at every turn.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Vibrant local culture and cuisine:</strong><br>
          The city’s culinary scene reflects centuries of Mediterranean influences—fresh seafood, olive oil, and local herbs take center stage. Traditional Dalmatian dishes like “black risotto” or “pasticada” are a must-try, and you’ll often find live music, street performers, and local artisans lining the cobblestone streets, adding to the lively atmosphere.

          <strong>Rich historical significance:</strong><br>
          Formerly known as the Republic of Ragusa, Dubrovnik was once a powerful maritime city-state rivaling Venice. Its legacy is still evident in its grand palaces, bustling port, and the strong sense of identity among locals. Recognized as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, Dubrovnik continues to preserve its heritage while welcoming travelers from around the globe.
